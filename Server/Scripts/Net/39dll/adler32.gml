/*
  This function creates checksum value of the data inside the buffer.
  This can be used for data verification.
  note: Checksums are similar to MD5 but faster and less accurate. It also
  returns a number not a string. Uses adler-32 checksum algorithm.
  The value can be sent as an unsigned int
